Yet another ASCII table plugin :). I often need to insert some high-ASCII character that my keymap doesn't allow to write and none of the *ASCII plugins I saw was so easy and quick to use, so I wrote my own. It's my first plugin for VIM and I welcome any bug reports, ideas and suggestions.

Since version 2.0 it has ability to use any number of intervals to display and  to use any file for character input. UTF8 is supported as well.
